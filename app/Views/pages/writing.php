These samples are essentially technical writing about technical writing, and the topics include the typically used frameworks used for creating and deploying content, as well as other subjects related to technical content creation.

                                <p>DITA provides a structured and modular approach to content creation, allowing for the development of topics that can be easily reused and repurposed. Our articles explore various DITA topics, such as typical elements and attributes, as well as many other basic DITA concepts.

                                <p>The ePub format is synonymous with digital publishing, offering a dynamic and adaptable platform for distributing documentation, while Adobe's PDF is the most ubiquitous, universal document format available.

I used <strong><a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_author.html" target="_blank">Oxygen XML Author</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">JetBrains PHP Storm</a></strong> to create this site. <strong><a href="https://github.com/codeigniter4/framework" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a></strong> is the open source MVC framework used. Check out the code for this project on <strong><a href="https://github.com/krshearman" target="_blank">Github <ion-icon name="logo-github"></ion-icon></a></strong>.
